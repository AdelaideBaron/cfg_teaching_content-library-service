This application was made for learning/developing:
- Testing (Junit, mocking), and
- Docker (creating an image, and using containers)

## How to use
1. Run `src/main/resources/database/init-library.sql` in MySQL workbench
2. Edit the configuration in application.yml to reflect your DB password and username (placeholders there currently)
